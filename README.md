# DreamPlan
Our project essentially attempts to combine both myers briggs like personality test with a schedule building program that assigns courses based off of potential interest.
We created a web application that takes course documentation such as subject matters, relevant credits and areas of interest into account to create a perfect schedule for a hypothetical student. Our designed purpose is to combat undergraduate stress as well as solve the problem of retention rate at colleges.
